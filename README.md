# Health Insurance Claim App with Solidity,Ethereum and Web3
Technologies: Solidity Smart Contract, Web3, Ethereum, Ganache, Meta mask, Jquery
Introduction to Health Insurance
This project is about creating a Health Insurance Claim application. The project is aimed to digitize traditional health insurance claims and reduce fraud with the help of technology. This application will not only reduce the manual work of the business but also will increase their efficiency and reduce the risk.
## Current System and Problems Faced In Current System:
As of now people fill paper form and submit to claim the insurance. Using paper form results in having to store those papers which is a tedious task. Similarly, the person
who approves the claim has to manually go through each form and approve it. This process is time consuming as well as in-efficient. There is risk of forms being misplaced
and arranging for the storage for the same is a challenge as well.
### Software Requirements:
1) Solidity Smart Contract
Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most
notably, Ethereum It was developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, and several former Ethereum core contributors to enable writing smart contracts on
blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. The programs compiled by Solidity are intended to be run on Ethereum Virtual Machine.
2) Web3-
Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. web3 is:
• Verifiable
• Trustless
• Self-governing
• Permissionless
• Distributed and robust
• Stateful
• Native built-in payments
In web3, developers don't usually build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database (usually hosted on and managed
by a single cloud provider). Instead, web3 applications either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the
two that forms a cryptoeconomic protocol. These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps), and you will see that term used often in the web3 space. To
achieve a stable and secure decentralized network, network participants (developers) are incentivized and compete to provide the highest quality services to anyone using
the service.
3) Ethereum
Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or
Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.
As a blockchain network, Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and
recording transactions. The network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use
applications on the platform, and use its Ether cryptocurrency as payment. Insiders
call the decentralized applications on the network "dApps."
4) JQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML
document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much
simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a
Name- Narottam Aswal SYMCA(M) Roll No-3
combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions
of people write JavaScript.
Advantages of this system:
1) Reduce manual work.
2) More efficient than the current system.
3) Reduce the risk of fraud.
4) Easy storage and maintenance of the documents
Features:
1) Authentication and Authorization- User cannot perform any action befor
authentication.
2) User and doctor dashboard.
3) Doctors with assigned claims can only approve/decline the claim request.
4) Automatic status and amount transfer once claim is approved.
